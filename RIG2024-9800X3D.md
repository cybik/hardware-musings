## What works

Damn near everything. On Wayland, no less

## What doesn't work

Boils down to *one* thing: the damn Audio

### Audio? That's something specific to yell about

Yep. This motherboard uses a Realtek ALC408x-based codec / sound card, which is based on the USB bus instead of classic I2C (if I read the interwebses correctly). Apparently, the [ALSA configuration](https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-ucm-conf/tree/master/ucm2/USB-Audio/Realtek) may or may not be "complete" or "thourough" enough, such that the S/PDIF socket (aka: TOSLINK optical out) does **_NOT_** do AC3/DTS/DD on Linux. It does on Windows though: I went to the bloody trouble of _installing Windows 10_, wasting 30min of my life ~(not like I was doing anything useful anyway)~, JUST to validate this.


## What's the verdict then?

If you read this on or around 11/11/24, chances are, you're trying to make the ASRock X870 Steel Legend WiFi work on Linux. It works by and large, except the sound, and even there it's mostly "okay". But if you NEED/WANT/DEMAND surround sound, Realtek ALC408x support is not **_quite_** at the point where I'd say it's feature-complete. Mostly there, probably.
